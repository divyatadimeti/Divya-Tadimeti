[Abstract](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-EgRc7ofm5xIlIa3ai4acg3Yzb3r0FXB/view?usp=sharing)\
My work evaluating conversational dialogue systems as a research intern at USC's ICT this summer, accepted to the Widening NLP workshop at EMNLP 2021.


#### FrameNet 
[Code](https://github.com/divyatadimeti/FrameNet-scripts) (Python)\
Python scripts written by me and a teammate to analyze political documents when I was a research assistant at ICSI on the [FrameNet project](https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/). One script uses NLTK to clean and find relative word frequencies in different documents. The other script uses NLTK, NetworkX, and Matplotlib to create a graphing tool to visualize word relationships.


#### Artificial Intelligence Projects
(Python)\
Projects I and one teammate have completed so far for UC Berkeley's CS 188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. (Due to honor code agreements, I am not allowed to publish my solutions/code online. However, here are project summaries, with more information in the Coursework section above.) These projects focus on the Pacman world in order to AI concepts like informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. 

###### Project 1: Search
We implemented graph-search algorithms (depth-first search, breadth-first search, uniform cost search, A* search) and heuristics to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in a Pacman maze. 

###### Project 2: Multi-agent Search
We implemented minimax, alpha beta pruning, expectimax, and an evaluation function to design agents for Pacman. 

###### Project 3: Reinforcement Learning
We implemented Q-learning and value iteration for Pacman agents.

###### Project 4: Ghostbusters
We implemented exact and approximate inference and particle filtering algorithms using Bayes Nets in order for Pacman to locate and track ghosts given noisy distance readings.
